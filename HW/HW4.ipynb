    "## Two-dimensional Ising model\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Ising model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model is one of the drosophila of physics. At first look, itâ€™s a simple model of crystalline materials which attributes magnetism to the orientation of magnetic moments on a lattice, summarized by the Hamiltonian or energy\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E=-\\sum_{i, j} J_{i j} s_i s_j+\\sum_i h_i s_i.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables $s_i$ express the possible orientations for each moment, while the entries $J_{i j}$ of the (symmetric) interaction matrix characterize the interaction energy of moments $i$ and $j$. The value $h_i$ specifies a magnetic field on each site $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ising's original formulation (often referred to as the Ising model) considers moments with two orientations, $s_i= \\pm 1$, which only interact with their nearest neighbors. Below we will call this the two-dimensional Ising model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A configuration of an Ising model is a specification of every moment's orientation - an assignment of values to the $s_i$ variable for all moments in the system. For our purposes, configurations are 'snapshots' of the system which our simulator will hold in memory, like a vector containing $\\pm 1$ in its $i$ th entry to specify whether moment $i$ points up or down.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Mechanics \n",
    "There are a couple facts we need to know about statistical mechanics.\n",
    "1. We can specify configurations of our system $c$. In the case of an Ising model, the configuration is the orientation of each spin.\n",
    "2. Each configuration $c$ has an energy $E(c)$. We've already seen this for the Ising model.\n",
    "3. For classical systems in contact with an energy reservoir of temperature $T$, the probability $P$ of finding the system in configuration $c$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(c)=\\frac{e^{-\\beta E(c)}}{\\sum_c e^{-\\beta E(c)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E(c)$ is the configuration's energy and $\\beta \\equiv 1 /(k T)$ with $k$ Boltzmann's constant and $T$ is the temperature. We will work in units where $k=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov Chains\n",
    "We have just learned that statistical mechanics tells us that if we look at the system, each configuration $c$ appears with probability $P(c) \\sim \\exp (-\\beta E(c))$. Our first goal is to implement an algorithm which gives us configurations $c$ with probability $P(c)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such algorithm is markov chain Monte Carlo(MCMC).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov chain is a process where you are at some state $c$ (i.e. a configuration) and then you choose another state $c^{\\prime}$ with a probability that only depends on $c$. In other words, you can't use the fact that previously you were at configuration $b$ to decide the probability $P\\left(c \\rightarrow c^{\\prime}\\right)$ you're going to go from $c$ to $c^{\\prime}$. This process is called a memoryless process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you do a (non-pathalogical) random walk in a memoryless way, you're guaranteed that, after walking around enough, that the probability you are in configuration $c$ is some $\\pi(c) . \\pi$ is called the stationary distribution. Different markov chains will have different stationary distributions. A Markov chain is nonpathological if:\n",
    "- It is aperiodic; it doesn't cycle between configurations in a subset of the system's full configuration space.\n",
    "- It is connected; given two configurations, there is a path with non-zero probability that the chain could (but not necessarily will) follow to get from one to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate the Ising model, we wish to build a markov chain which has the stationary distribution $\\pi(c) \\sim \\exp \\left(-\\beta E_c\\right)$. We will do so with a very famous algorithm which lets us build a Markov chain for any $\\pi(c)$ we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know your desired stationary distribution, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm provides a canonical way to generate a Markov chain that produces it.  The steps of the algorithm are:\n",
    "- Start with some configuration $c$\n",
    "- Propose a move to a new trial configuration $c^{\\prime}$ with a transition probability $T\\left(c \\rightarrow c^{\\prime}\\right)$\n",
    "- Accept the move to $c^{\\prime}$ with probability $\\min \\left(1, \\frac{\\pi\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\pi(c)} \\frac{T\\left(c^{\\prime} \\rightarrow c\\right)}{T\\left(c \\rightarrow c^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right)$"

% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\begin{itemize}
\item N-dimensional homogeneous arrays (ndarray) 
\item Universal functions (ufunc)
\begin{itemize}
\item built-in linear algebra, FFT, PRNGs 
\end{itemize}
\item Tools for integrating with C/C++/Fortran 
\item Heavy lifting done by optimized C/Fortran libraries
\begin{itemize}
\item ATLAS or MKL, UMFPACK, FFTW, etc...
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Basics}
\begin{itemize}
\item NumPy's main object is the \alert{homogeneous multidimensional array}. 
\item This is a table of elements indexed by a tuple of positive integers.
\item  Arrays can have several dimensions or \alert{axes}. 
\item The number of axes will often be called \alert{rank}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Attributes}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ndarray.ndim}: the number of axes (dimensions) of the array, or the rank. 
\item {\tt ndarray.shape}: the dimensions of the array.  
\begin{itemize}
\item For a matrix with $n$ rows and $m$ columns, shape will be $(n,m)$. 
\item The length of the shape tuple is therefore the rank, or number of dimensions, $ndim$.
\end{itemize}
\item {\tt ndarray.size}: the total number of elements of the array.\item {\tt ndarray.dtype}: an object describing the type of the elements in the array. 
\item {\tt ndarray.itemsize}: the size in bytes of each element of the array. 
\item {\tt ndarray.data} the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
